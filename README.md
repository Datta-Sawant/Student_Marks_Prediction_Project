# Student_Marks_Prediction_Project
## Objectives
- Education is very important issue regarding development of a country. The main objective of educational institutions is to provide high quality education to its students. One way to accomplish this is by predicting student's academic performance and thereby taking early steps to improve student's performance and teaching quality. 


- This Project aims to predict student's marks using linear regression. The idea behind this analysis is to predict the marks of students by their studying hours.Through this project we can determine:



  - How many hours need to do the study to get ?% marks.
  - If I will do study ? hours per day so how much marks I will get
  
- Through these points the school/College can determine the performance of the student.

## Student marks Prediction model.
I created a student marks prediction model with the help of following few steps like :

1. Define project objectives
2. Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning , Data Preparation , split into train and test , Feature Scaling).
3. Model Selection
4. Data Collection
5. Data Visualization
6. Model Building
7. Deploy Model


- This Web App is deployed to cloud (AWS EC2) where it can be accesssed. Running last command above will prompt that server is running on port 8000 i.e. http://ec2-13-234-136-185.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/ Now just load your cloud url in browser (for me it was ), website will open but it will not work unless I run this app's server in virtual OS Ubuntu.

At the end after building our model we will test that what will be predicted score if a student study for ? hrs in a day.
